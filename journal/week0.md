Week-0 summary - 
1. Creating the conceptual diagrams and creating architecture diagrams on lucid charts - this was very new to me, I learned a lot during the process but was still a bit confused about these diagrams.
2. Revised all the concepts of AWS IAM services - users, roles, and permissions.
3. Learnt about AWS organizations, SCP, etc.
4. Also deep-dived into STS and other important concepts.
5. Learnt about AWS Billings and Budgets - still a bit confused about these. 
6. Did hands-on on setting up an IAM user and playing around with permissions and setting up budgets and billing alarms.
